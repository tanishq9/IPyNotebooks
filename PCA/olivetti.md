PCA is meant for  mapping the  originally high-dimensional training data to their low-dimensional representations.  Found the optimum number of components needed for getting 99% variance i.e the directions which contain maximum information about the dataset and then used PCA for further transforming the data into 99% data without losing much information and then chose Logistic regression from sci-kit learn as the classifier for training the transformed dataset. Got an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset.
